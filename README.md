# 3D Raytracer in Processing

Welcome to the **3D Raytracer**! This project is a 3D rendering engine built entirely in [Processing](https://processing.org/). It simulates realistic lighting and shadows using ray tracing techniques.

## Features
- Renders spheres and planes with realistic reflections and shading.
- Simple and intuitive codebase for experimentation and learning.
- Built entirely in Processing – just download and run!

## Requirements
- [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/) (tested with version 4.x or later).

## How to Play
1. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-raytracer.git
     ```
   - Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Open in Processing**:
   - Open the `.pde` file in the Processing IDE.

3. **Run the Sketch**:
   - Press the **Run** button (▶️) in Processing to start the raytracer.

4. **Enjoy the Rendered Scene**:
   - The sketch will render a 3D scene with spheres and planes.
   - Move the sphere around  with displayed keys to test shadows and reflections.
